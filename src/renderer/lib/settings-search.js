/**
 * Filtering a settings page down to the settings that mention what was typed.
 *
 * This works on what the page has drawn, not on a list of settings kept beside
 * it. A page is several dozen rows spread over sections that each build their
 * own markup, and an index of them would be one more thing to remember to edit
 * every time a row is added, in five languages. The text on screen is already
 * translated, already current, and already the words the user is looking at,
 * so it is what gets searched.
 *
 * Three kinds of block take part, each marked by the component that draws it:
 * a group (a heading over several cards, see ServersPage), a card (SettingCard)
 * and a row (SettingRow). They nest, and a block is kept when its own words
 * match or when anything inside it is kept. A block whose own words match
 * keeps everything inside it too, so searching for a card's heading shows the
 * whole card rather than a heading over nothing.
 *
 * Hidden blocks are marked with an attribute rather than taken out of the
 * tree: the sections keep their state, and clearing the search puts every row
 * back exactly as it was. React leaves attributes it did not set alone, so the
 * marks survive a re-render; anything React mounts afresh is caught by the
 * observer in SettingsPage and filtered again.
