                typed on. That is what lets the model chip carry a real
                label instead of an icon, and it keeps a long question from
                squeezing the buttons.

                No rule above it, and no surface of its own: the outline is
                what says "type here", and a divider as well would cut the

                matching the card, because the card is translucent and
                painting the same wash twice makes a pale rectangle of the
                one part of the panel that should sit flat.

                Focus lifts the border's colour and nothing else, as every
                other input in the app does. A ring would add two pixels
                outside the box and nudge the whole composer as you click
                into it.
