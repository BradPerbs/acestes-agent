/**
 * The tools that put a live chart in the conversation.
 *
 * watch_metric runs a command, on a server or on this computer, and pulls a
 * number out of what it prints with a regular expression the agent writes
 * for the occasion; the chart follows it in the chat after the turn is over.
 * read_metric is how the agent sees the same numbers, and stop_metric ends
 * one. The work is in live-metrics.js; the conversation's side of it (the
 * events, the window) comes in on `ctx.metrics`, built in index.js.
 *
 * Built by tools.js with its helpers, like the job tools.
